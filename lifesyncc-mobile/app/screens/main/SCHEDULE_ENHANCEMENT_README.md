## Usage Instructions

### To integrate the enhanced screen:

1. Replace the import in your navigation file:
```typescript
// Old import
import { ScheduleScreen } from './app/screens/main/ScheduleScreen';

// New import
import { ScheduleScreenEnhanced as ScheduleScreen } from './app/screens/main/ScheduleScreenEnhanced';
```

### Gesture Support
- **Daily View**: Swipe left/right to navigate between days
- **All Views**: Use arrow buttons for navigation
- **Week/Month Views**: Tap on any day to view its details

### Visual Indicators
- **Task Categories**: Color-coded dots (Physical: Green, Mental: Purple, Financial: Orange, Social: Blue, Personal: Pink)
- **Today**: Blue border in weekly view, light blue background in monthly view
- **Selected Date**: Purple background
- **Task Count**: Small badges showing number of tasks

## API Integration
All views use the existing `scheduleService` for data fetching:
- Weekly view fetches 7 days of data in parallel
- Monthly view fetches only current month days
- Caching is utilized for better performance

## Performance Optimizations
- Lazy loading of schedule data
- Parallel API calls for bulk data fetching
- Animated transitions between views
- Efficient re-rendering with proper state management

## Future Enhancements
- Drag-and-drop task rescheduling
- Multi-day task support
- Export functionality
- Task filtering by category
- Recurring task templates
